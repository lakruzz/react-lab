# React lab

Using the [react tutorial on W3C school](https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/) as a test for a basic setup.

The end goal is to run some react code in an Electron app, communicating with the CLIs on the host machine.

In other word, this is not a web app. But rather an example on how tool-developers (CLI's and Desktop apps) can utilize React, and CSS for frontend.

At the same time, this is also adhereing to DevX princiiples and the first thing we do is to setup a containerized development environment, utilizing Dev containers in VS Code.
